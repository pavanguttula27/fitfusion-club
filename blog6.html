    <p class="fs-5">Even with great intentions, gym-goers often make avoidable mistakes that stall progress or increase injury risk. First, neglecting proper warm-up is common—jumping into heavy sets without a dynamic warm-up can reduce performance and increase injury risk. Second, poor exercise technique (especially on compound lifts) compromises results and safety; prioritize form and controlled tempos over ego lifting. Third, inconsistent programming—frequently changing programs or not tracking progress—prevents progressive overload and measurable gains. Fourth, underestimating recovery and sleep: training hard without adequate rest reduces adaptation and raises injury risk. Fifth, poor nutrition—assuming you can out-train bad food choices—will significantly limit progress. Addressing these areas involves planning: establish a structured routine with a sensible warm-up, learn and practice proper technique (consider coaching), track workouts to ensure progressive overload, prioritize sleep and nutrition, and include deloads or recovery phases to stay healthy long-term. Small corrections in these common mistakes lead to consistent progress and fewer setbacks.</p>
