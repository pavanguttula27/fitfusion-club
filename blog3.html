    <p class="fs-5">Losing body fat while preserving muscle is a common goal and entirely achievable with the right approach. The first principle is to create a moderate calorie deficit — typically 10–20% below maintenance — which allows fat loss without excessive muscle breakdown. Avoid crash diets; aggressive deficits increase the risk of losing lean tissue. Resistance training is crucial: continue or begin weight training 2–4 times per week to provide the muscle with an anabolic stimulus. Prioritize protein — consuming sufficient protein preserves muscle and supports recovery. Aim for about 1.6–2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily, spread across meals. Include progressive overload in your training to maintain or even add strength during dieting. Cardio is useful for increasing calorie burn but shouldn’t replace strength work — balance low-intensity steady-state sessions with high-intensity intervals if desired. Timing of nutrients can help: eating protein and carbs around workouts supports performance and recovery. Sleep and stress management are often overlooked; elevated stress and poor sleep raise cortisol and can impair muscle retention. Supplements like creatine monohydrate and whey protein are well-researched tools that can support performance and muscle maintenance. Finally, be patient and monitor progress through body measurements, strength logs, and photos rather than solely relying on the scale. A sustainable, strength-focused fat loss plan preserves muscle, keeps energy higher, and leads to better long-term results than rapid weight loss strategies.</p>
