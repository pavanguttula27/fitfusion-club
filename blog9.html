    <p class="fs-5">Sleep is a cornerstone of recovery and muscle growth. During deep sleep, the body releases growth hormone, which helps repair tissues and promote muscle synthesis. Inadequate sleep impairs protein synthesis, reduces glycogen restoration, and negatively affects appetite-regulating hormones like leptin and ghrelin—often leading to poor food choices. For athletes and strength trainees, aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night. Prioritize sleep hygiene: maintain a consistent bedtime, limit screens before bed, keep the bedroom cool and dark, and avoid heavy meals or caffeine late in the day. Naps can be a useful supplement for busy schedules but don’t rely on them to replace consistent nightly sleep. Combining regular resistance training, adequate protein intake, and consistent sleep habits creates an environment where muscle repair and growth are optimized. If sleep problems persist, consult a professional to rule out sleep disorders. Remember: training stimulus without recovery yields diminishing returns; sleep is the multiplier that makes your workouts effective.</p>
