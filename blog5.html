    <p class="fs-5">High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) combines short bursts of near-maximal effort with recovery periods, and its popularity stems from efficiency and strong metabolic effects. From a scientific perspective, HIIT improves cardiovascular fitness, insulin sensitivity, and mitochondrial function. The high-intensity bouts elevate heart rate and oxygen demand, mobilizing energy stores and creating an afterburn effect—known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC)—which contributes to increased calorie burn after the workout. Protocols vary: classic Tabata (20 seconds on, 10 seconds off), sprint intervals, or circuit-style intervals using bodyweight or equipment. HIIT is time-efficient, often yielding similar cardio and metabolic benefits to longer steady-state sessions in less time. However, HIIT is demanding; appropriate progression and recovery are necessary to avoid overtraining. For beginners, start with lower volumes—fewer intervals at moderate intensity—and slowly increase work time or intensity. Combining HIIT with resistance training can improve body composition, but sequencing matters: avoid doing maximal HIIT immediately before heavy strength sessions to prevent performance compromise. Finally, HIIT’s benefits hinge on quality execution—maximal intent during work intervals and full or adequate recovery—so structure sessions intentionally and allow rest days as needed.</p>
