    <p class="fs-5">If you’ve never lifted weights before, starting strength training can feel intimidating. The good news: with a simple, structured approach, almost anyone can safely and effectively increase strength, confidence, and body composition. Begin with a focus on compound movements — exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, overhead presses, and rows. These movements deliver the most “bang for your buck” and build foundational strength. Start with two to three full-body workouts per week, allowing at least 48 hours between sessions for recovery. For the first 4–6 weeks prioritize learning technique over heavy loads; use lighter weights or even just bodyweight until movement patterns feel solid. Gradually increase load using the principle of progressive overload — add small increments of weight, or increase repetitions, each week. Include accessory work (lunges, curls, triceps work) to balance muscle development and reduce injury risk. Warm-up thoroughly with dynamic mobility and a few light sets before the working sets. Rest periods of 60–120 seconds between heavy sets work well for beginners. Nutrition matters: aim for adequate protein intake (roughly 1.6–2.2g/kg bodyweight) and ensure you eat enough calories to support strength gains. Sleep and recovery are essential; muscles grow during rest. Finally, track progress — log weights, sets, and reps. Consistency, progressive overload, and smart recovery are the pillars of beginner strength training. If unsure, consult a certified coach for personalized programming and form feedback.</p>
