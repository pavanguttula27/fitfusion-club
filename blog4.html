    <p class="fs-5">Effective post-workout nutrition speeds recovery and prepares you for the next training session. After exercise the body needs protein to repair muscle fibers and carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores—especially after intense or long workouts. Aim for 20–40 grams of high-quality protein depending on body size; sources include lean meats, dairy, eggs, or a protein shake. Pair protein with a carbohydrate source—rice, potatoes, fruits, or oats—to optimize recovery. Healthy fats are fine but keep them moderate immediately post-workout to not slow digestion if rapid refueling is desired. Hydration is equally important; replace fluids and electrolytes lost through sweat, particularly during long sessions or in hot environments. Foods like Greek yogurt with fruit, chicken and sweet potato, or a balanced smoothie with whey protein, banana, and spinach provide an effective post-workout meal. For evening workouts, focus on a balanced meal that supports recovery without interfering with sleep—lean protein and complex carbs are ideal. Additionally, include antioxidant-rich foods (berries, leafy greens) to support inflammation control. Timing within an hour post-exercise is practical for most people but don’t stress if that window is missed—total daily protein and carbohydrate intake matter more than exact timing for recreational trainees. Lastly, consistent daily nutritional habits paired with adequate sleep and progressive training will compound into better performance and recovery over time.</p>
