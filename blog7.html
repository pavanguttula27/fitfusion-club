    <p class="fs-5">Yoga is an ancient practice that combines physical postures, breath control, and mindfulness. For modern fitness enthusiasts, yoga offers a potent combination of stress relief, flexibility gains, and improved body awareness. Practices such as Hatha or Vinyasa improve mobility and teach breath-work techniques that reduce sympathetic nervous system activity (the &#x27;fight or flight&#x27; response). Simple poses like child’s pose, downward dog, pigeon pose, and gentle spinal twists target tight hips, hamstrings, and lower back—the areas most athletes neglect. Incorporating 20–30 minutes of yoga 2–3 times weekly enhances recovery, improves posture, and reduces injury risk by balancing mobility and strength. Additionally, mindfulness and breath exercises lower cortisol levels and improve sleep quality—both crucial for athletic performance. For beginners, focus on consistency and proper alignment; consider following experienced instructors or classes that emphasize technique. Yoga complements strength and cardio training by adding a mobility and recovery-focused component to your routine.</p>
